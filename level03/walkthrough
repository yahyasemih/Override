In this level, we have most of the exploits disabled, so most probably we don't have to corrupt the binary but understand it instead
After investigating the assembly using GDB, we see that the program ask for a number and do some test on it
if the test passes then the program opens the shell
the test takes the input and an other number (0x1337d00d) and give the difference between them to a decrypt function
if they meet some requirement, pass a random number otherwise
decrypt basically apply XOR between the number and chars of a string and if the result is 'Congratulations!' then the shell is opened
