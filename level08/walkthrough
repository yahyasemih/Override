In this level the program wait for a filename to open and writes its content to a backup directory
located in the home directory (which is also owned by level09)
the program takes the filename and concatenated it to "./backups" and try to open
both  "./backups/filename" and "filename"
we can't give a relative path to level09's .pass file because the program can't write into level08 home directory
so the solution is to create a symbolic link and use it

~$ ln -s ../level09/.pass link
~$ ./level08
~$ cat backups/link
