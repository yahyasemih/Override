In this level the program asks for a username and a password,
if the password correspond to the next level pass then the program opens the shell
otherwise it prints that the username does not have access

to exploit this program we can use the fact the the username is directly printed by printf
so we can do string format attack

when we give ass username multiple %p formats we notice that at some points
it starts to print those formats and also the content of the pass given by the user
between them we have the content of the pass (in the source code we can see that
first we have the username array then the pass array and after it the user pass)

so all what we have to do is process what is between the username and the password
and get the flag
