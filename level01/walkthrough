In this leve, the program ask the user to enter a username, if it is equal to 'dat_wil' then it asks for a password which should be 'admin'
even if we enter the reauired values, the program do nothing (see source code),
but we notice that if we enter the valid username then asking for password is not done well using gets;
the size given to fgets is greater than the size of the buffer, so we can perform a buffer overflow attack

we start by setting a string in the env variables and get it address
export SHELL='cat /home/users/level02/.pass'
and the we run this payload to make the program call system and cat the pass
python -c "print 'dat_wil'+'C'*328 +'\xd0\xae\xe6\xf7'+'aaaa'+'\xb1\xd8\xff\xff'" | ./level01

'dat_wil'+'C'*328 is because the first fgets requires 256 - 1 characters and the remaining characters are for overflowing the second buffer

we don't care about where the program should continue after system so we just give 'aaaa'
